This is a MERN blog project using:

- React js
- TypeScript
- Boostrap
  to track my progress through the exercises from the book "Eloquent Javascript -3rd edition" by Marijn Haverbeke

MERN = mongoDB (noSQL database), Express(restful API), React (frontend), Node.js(backend) + firebase(server)

This is my first project using typescript, and I'm following the tutorial by 'The Nerdy Canuck' on youtube 2021
